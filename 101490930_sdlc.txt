It combines development and operations, making software development faster and more reliable. By using automation, testing, and continuous deployment, DevOps reduces errors and speeds up software releases. It also improves communication between teams, ensuring that updates and fixes happen smoothly. Overall, DevOps makes the entire development process more efficient, leading to better software and happier users.
